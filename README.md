## Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge                                      | Solution                                              |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Implementing efficient database indexing      | Used MySQL Indexing to optimize queries        |
| Managing concurrent API requests             | Implemented asynchronous processing using Celery & RabbitMQ |
| Securing APIs and user authentication        | Used JWT authentication & OAuth for enhanced security |
| Handling large file uploads in Django        | Utilized cloud storage solutions (AWS S3) |

---

## Best Practices & Takeaways
- Write **modular and reusable** code following **SOLID** and **DRY** principles.
- Use **Docker** for containerization and easy deployment.
- Implement **logging and monitoring** for debugging and analytics.
- Always write **unit tests and integration tests** for API endpoints.
- Follow **CI/CD workflows** for seamless production deployments.
- Prioritize **security** with proper authentication & data encryption.
